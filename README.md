# CRM Frontend

This is the repository of the CRM Frontend - part of the CRM Fullstack Application.

## High Level Overview

The CRM Frontend is responsible for maintaining relationships with clients and potential clients. It allows for organization of various Accounts, Contacts, and Leads currently, each of which belongs to a particular end user upon entry into the system.

The CRM Frontend is the main way users interact with the CRM Backend found [here](https://github.com/ChristopherH-eth/Lumen-crm-website-backend), and is built using ReactJS. It represents the 'view' of the MVC architecture that this application is designed around, and handles the sending of client requests to the CRM Backend, as well as the display of relevant responses to the user.
